To run the script: python hillCipher.py 

The script can encrypt or decrypt given a text and key. 
For encryption, give the option as 'e' and for decryption give the option as 'd'.
The key provided will be mapped into the 2x2 keyMatrix which is used for encryption/decryption.
If the length of key is not 4, the default key "hill" is used.
The cipher is based on the 26 letter English alphabet set.
