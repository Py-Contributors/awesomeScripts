# Muvo - A CLI-based file mover/copier

This folder contains an .exe, and two source code files, one for CLI paramater-based runs and one for simple interactive console-based runs.

For 'Muvo-CLI.py', run with the parameters, as defined.

muvo.py - a small program for moving and copying multiple files based on extensions. You can give multiple extensions to search for among a single directory and it'll traverse all sub-directories and copy/move the files with the specified extension. Enjoy!

muvo_cli.py - same as above but with parameters as:
                    --extensions
                    --parentdir
                    --finaldir
                    --copymove
                    --log
