# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME

Python-Language based Project

### OBJECTIVE:
This project aims to develop a Tic Tac Toe game using python. It mainly consists of developing and implementing a computer program that plays Tic Tac Toe against another player.<br/>
In order to understand what Tic Tac Toe game is and how to play the game, below is the description.

### GAME DESCRIPTION:
Play a classic game of Tic Tac Toe with a twist. We've made it so that the board is 3x3 and you can use the computer or another person to play against. It includes different difficulty levels, so anyone can enjoy this game. Add in a timer so you can keep track of your time, and you've got the perfect game on your hands!

Tic Tac Toe is a game which is played on a three-by-three grid. It's also known as Naughts and Crosses, or Xs and Os.

### GAME RULES:
A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual game uses “X” and “O”. 
1.	The player that gets to play first will get the "X" mark (we call him/her player 1) and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" mark (we call him/her player 2).

2.	Player 1 and 2 take turns making moves with Player 1 playing mark “X” and Player 2 playing mark “O”.
3.	A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark (“X” or “O”) and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intensions:
a. One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
b. If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw/tie.

### IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
