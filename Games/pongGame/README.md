# Pong Game In Python

Before starting with the coding part we first need to install the turtle module. The turtle module is a Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas.

If you donâ€™t already have it, you can install the library using pip.
```
C:\Users\Admin>pip install turtle
```
