Albert Einstein (/ˈælbərt ˈaɪnstaɪn/; German: [ˈalbɐt ˈaɪnʃtaɪn] ( listen); 
14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist 
who developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two 
pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). 
While best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 
(which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), 
he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, 
and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".
