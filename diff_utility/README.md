# Diff Utility

A diff utility takes in two files and command-line arguments and compares them for changes. The changes are then shown as output indication what has changed where.

## How to get started?

Any version of Python 3 is good enough to run this program. Additionally the ``rich`` package is required. Install it via the terminal.

```
pip install rich
```

Or

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the program

Run the program from the terminal as follows:

```
python diff.py <file1.txt> <file2.txt>
```

Or on Linux do:

```
./diff.py <file1.txt> <file2.txt>
```
