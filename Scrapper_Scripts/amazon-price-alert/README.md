# Amazon prices keep fluctuating- Let's scrape them!
 ### Developed by [Sarthak Saxena](https://github.com/sarthak1905) 
 C3PO is a web-scraper built on BeautifulSoup that alerts you when the price of an amazon prduct falls within your budget! Currently in development.
 
 ## What is the use?
 Nothing is worse than seeing the price drop of a product you just bought on Amazon drop 2 days after you bought it. Wouldn't it be amazing if a python script could just 
 ask you your budget and the product link and then notify you when the product price drops below that? This is exactly what this script does!
 
 ## How to use 
 * Simply copy the link of the product and your budget that's it!
 * Paste the link when the program requests you to 
 * Enter budget for the product(without currency symbol) 
 * Select frequency to check prices
 * Keep the script running in the background
 The scraper will do the rest for you and notify you when the price is in your budget.
 However, it is to be kept in mind that the sender email ID and password has been stored in os variables in the script. Therefore, wherever you see the imports of 
 'DEVELOPER_EMAIL' and 'DEVELOPER_PASS', be sure to replace them with the email ID you wish to recieve the notification from.
