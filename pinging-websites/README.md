# Pinging Websites

Ping a website or your own personal server and get instant emails whenever the server is down.

Details are mentioned in the Python file too, wherever edits and user inputs are required.


### Inputs required

Add the list of servers and ports (ports are not necessary if it is an HTTPS website and default ports are being used) as string and integer respectively in the list of servers.
Add the emails where the mails are to be sent where it is asked to. You can add upto 50 emails as string in the list.
Add a Gmail email and password of the account from which mails are supposed to be sent. You will have to enable access to less secure apps from on that Google account from [here](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps). Read about it in the [Gmail Docs](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python).


### Run

Just run the Python file.

```python
python pinging.py
```
Use a batch file to easily run this easily without the hassle of terminals and IDEs. A batch file has already been added as an example.
