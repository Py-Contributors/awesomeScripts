Created a URL Shortner using python
My whole code works as first you have to enter total how many urls you want to short 
then you will add url one by one and get output of shortened url respectively.


I have used python dictionary so that if you add the same urls again you will get the same shortened url in return.
My urlshort function return the shortend url with random prefixes and suffix.
Thankyou
