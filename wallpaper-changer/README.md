# wallpaper-changer

A script written in Python using the windll API of the ctypes library which uses the randint() method of the random module to select an image from a set of already provided images in a specified folder(here, the wallpapers folder) in the root directory to set as the Desktop wallpaper at any time of your choice(here, set at 2200 hrs as default) every day using the schedule module.

To use this script, 
1. Install the dependencies mentioned in "requirements.txt"
2. Add what images you would like to keep as the Desktop wallpapers in the "wallpapers" directory.
3. open the script in a text editor of your choice and change some or all of the variables according to your need (like the time of change)

WARNING:- this script will continue to run as a bakcground process at all times so please keep that in mind
Also, more functionality to come soon! (maybe)
