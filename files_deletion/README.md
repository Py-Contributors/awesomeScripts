##### Python Script for batch-deleting files

Starting with a need to delete all the (.srt) files from few folders that I had, it was too long to do manually, here Python helps. 

For your own usage on any directory, only change the root path of the folder that you want the script to work on, and the file extension of the files that you want to delete, and run the script. it works !!

Any ideas for improvement will be accepted with LOVE.
