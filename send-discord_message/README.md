## What is webhooks

A webhook is an API concept that’s growing in popularity. As more and more of what we do on the web can be described by events, webhooks are becoming even more applicable. They’re incredibly useful and a resource-light way to implement event reactions.


### How to Use

- Enter WEBHOOK_URL in auth.py

```bash
python main.py
```

## Future improvment

- Checkbox to sendMessage to muptiple channel
